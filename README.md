The game is a simple memory matching game. You click on card and it will flip over. Find the same card and match them.
Match all the cards and you win!

## Features

With this memory matching game, you:
* will have a timer that lets you know how long it took to complete them game.
* a star rating to let you know how well you did.
* a move counter to inform how many moves it took.

## Code Dependencies

In order to shuffle the function, I used a shuffle function provided in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976).

The game uses a few libraries:
1. [SweetAlert2](https://github.com/sweetalert2/sweetalert2) - to alert the player they won the game.
2. [easytimer.js](https://github.com/albert-gonzalez/easytimer.js) - a timer library to let the player know how long their game took.
